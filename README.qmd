# bracketeer <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="150" />

**Model and run tournament competitions in R.**

bracketeer has a pipe-first API: stage types are verbs, you chain them to describe the structure, then drive it live with result entry. Downstream stages materialize automatically when their source completes.

```{r}
#| label: teaser
library(bracketeer)

teams <- paste("Team", LETTERS[1:16])

tournament(teams) |>
  swiss("open", rounds = 5) |>
  single_elim("playoffs", take = top_n(8))
```

The definition reads like a rulebook. The runtime feels like a scoreboard.

## Installation

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("bbtheo/bracketeer")
```

Or try it right now without installing anything — open the World Cup 2026
simulation notebook in Google Colab:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bbtheo/bracketeer/blob/main/notebooks/world_cup_2026.ipynb)

## A complete tournament

Four teams. A group stage, then a final for the top two. Definition to champion in one session.

```{r}
#| label: build
teams <- c("Lions", "Bears", "Eagles", "Wolves")

trn <- tournament(teams) |>
  round_robin("groups") |>
  single_elim("grand_final", take = top_n(2))

trn
```

`groups` opens immediately. `grand_final` is blocked until two teams qualify. Use `matches()` to get the schedule:

```{r}
#| label: enter-results
m <- matches(trn, "groups")

trn <- results(trn, "groups", data.frame(
  match  = m$match_id,
  score1 = c(2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1),
  score2 = c(1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0)
))

trn
```

When the last group result lands, `grand_final` materializes automatically. No explicit advance call needed.

```{r}
#| label: standings
standings(trn, "groups")
```

```{r}
#| label: play-final
final_m <- matches(trn, "grand_final")

trn <- result(trn, "grand_final",
  match = final_m$match_id[[1]],
  score = c(3, 1)
)

winner(trn)
```

## Stage formats

Stage types are the verbs. Chain them onto `tournament()` to describe any
competition structure. The `from =` argument defaults to the previous stage,
so linear chains need no wiring at all.

### Round-robin

Every participant plays every other participant. Standings accumulate points
across all matches; `groups =` runs parallel group play within a single stage
node.

*Used in: Premier League, NBA regular season, FIFA World Cup group stage,
Champions League league phase.*

```{r}
#| label: world-cup
# World Cup style: 8 groups of 4, top 2 per group advance
teams_32 <- paste("Nation", sprintf("%02d", 1:32))

tournament(teams_32) |>
  round_robin("groups", groups = 8) |>
  single_elim("round_of_16", take = top_per_group(2))
```

### Swiss system

Participants are paired against others with the same current record across a
fixed number of rounds. Nobody is eliminated during the stage — the final
standings feed the next one.

*Used in: chess olympiads, Magic: The Gathering GPs, Counter-Strike and
VALORANT major group stages, Pokémon World Championships.*

```{r}
#| label: linear-chain
# Open qualifier → top 2 into a playoff final
tournament(teams) |>
  swiss("open", rounds = 3) |>
  single_elim("playoffs", take = top_n(2))
```

### Single elimination

One loss ends your tournament. The simplest bracket, and the most common
knockout format. Use `from =` explicitly when two stages branch from the
same source.

*Used in: NCAA March Madness, Wimbledon, FIFA World Cup knockout rounds,
NFL playoffs.*

```{r}
#| label: branching
# Championship track and a consolation bracket from the same group stage
tournament(teams) |>
  round_robin("groups") |>
  single_elim("championship", from = "groups", take = top_n(2)) |>
  single_elim("consolation",  from = "groups", take = remaining())
```

### Double elimination

Two losses to be eliminated. Runs a winners bracket and a losers bracket in
parallel — every entrant gets a second chance before they're out.

*Used in: StarCraft II WCS, VALORANT Champions, most fighting-game majors
(EVO), Dota 2 The International.*

```{r}
#| label: double-elim
tournament(teams) |>
  double_elim("bracket")
```

### Two-leg knockout

Each tie is played home and away; the aggregate score over both legs decides
who advances. Supports `away_goals = TRUE` for the classic away-goals rule.

*Used in: UEFA Champions League knockout rounds, Copa Libertadores, Europa
League.*

```{r}
#| label: two-leg
# UCL style: 4 groups of 4, top 2 per group into two-leg knockouts
teams_16 <- paste("Club", sprintf("%02d", 1:16))

tournament(teams_16) |>
  round_robin("groups", groups = 4) |>
  two_leg("knockouts", take = top_per_group(2))
```

All routing selectors — `top_n`, `top_per_group`, `remaining`, `losers`,
`slice_range`, `filter_by`, and their `_per_group` variants — sit in `take =`
and evaluate against the source stage's standings at transition time.

## The spec path

Define a blueprint without participants, validate it, then reuse it across
different fields:

```{r}
#| label: spec-path
#| output: false
my_spec <- spec() |>
  round_robin("groups") |>
  single_elim("finals",      from = "groups", take = top_n(2)) |>
  single_elim("consolation", from = "groups", take = remaining())

validate(my_spec, n = 16)   # errors loudly if routing is infeasible
```

```{r}
#| label: build-from-spec
trn2 <- build(my_spec, teams)
trn2
```

## Entering results

```{r}
#| label: result-entry-demo
# One at a time
trn2 <- result(trn2, "groups", match = 1, score = c(2, 1))

# Batch: a data frame with columns match, score1, score2
more <- matches(trn2, "groups")
trn2 <- results(trn2, "groups", data.frame(
  match  = more$match_id,
  score1 = rep(2L, nrow(more)),
  score2 = rep(0L, nrow(more))
))
```

`score = c(home, away)` — always a numeric vector. For best-of series, pass per-game scores and bracketeer sums them: `score = c(1, 0, 1, 0, 1)`.

## Inspecting state

```{r}
#| label: inspection
stage_status(trn)

routing_log(trn)
```

## Manual advance (opt-in)

Auto-advance is the default. Pass `auto_advance = FALSE` to control each stage transition yourself:

```{r}
#| label: manual-advance
trn_m <- tournament(teams, auto_advance = FALSE) |>
  round_robin("groups") |>
  single_elim("grand_final", take = top_n(2))

m <- matches(trn_m, "groups")
trn_m <- results(trn_m, "groups", data.frame(
  match  = m$match_id,
  score1 = c(2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1),
  score2 = c(1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0)
))

# Groups are complete but grand_final hasn't opened yet
stage_status(trn_m)
```

```{r}
#| label: explicit-advance
trn_m <- advance(trn_m, "groups")
stage_status(trn_m)
```
